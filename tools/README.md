# AoC Agent Tools

## generate_site.py

This tool generates a static website using MkDocs to showcase the reports generated by the AoC Agent.

### Features
- Scans `data*` directories for run data.
- Extracts metadata (agent, model, duration, success status).
- Copies reports and visualization assets (images, GIFs).
- Creates a structured "geeky" documentation site using `mkdocs-material`.
- Generates a Mission Control dashboard (index page) with an overview of all runs.

### Usage

1. **Prerequisites**
   You need to have Python installed. You also need `mkdocs` and `mkdocs-material` to build and serve the site.
   
   ```bash
   pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
   ```

2. **Generate the Site**
   Run the script from the project root:
   
   ```bash
   python tools/generate_site.py
   ```
   
   This will scan for runs and create a `report_site` directory.

3. **View the Site**
   Navigate to the generated directory and serve it:
   
   ```bash
   cd report_site
   mkdocs serve
   ```
   
   Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

### Configuration
You can modify `tools/generate_site.py` to change:
- `DATA_DIRS_PATTERN`: Where to look for data (default: `data*`).
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: Output directory (default: `report_site`).
- Theme settings in the `mkdocs.yml` generation section.

### Publishing to GitHub Pages

You can easily publish the generated site to GitHub Pages using the helper script.

1. **Prerequisites**
   - The project must be a git repository connected to GitHub.
   - You must have write access to push to the repository.
   - mkdocs and mkdocs-material must be installed.

2. **Publish**
   Run the publish script:
   
   `ash
   python tools/publish_site.py
   `

   This will:
   - Regenerate the site to ensure it's up-to-date.
   - Use mkdocs gh-deploy to push the built static site to the gh-pages branch.

3. **GitHub Settings**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **Pages**.
   - Under **Build and deployment**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
   - Select gh-pages as the branch and / (root) as the folder.
   - Click **Save**.
